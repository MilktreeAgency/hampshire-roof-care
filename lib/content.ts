      <h3>Common Signs You Need a Roof Repair</h3>
      <p>Your roof not only protects yourself and your family members, but your fixtures and fittings and personal belongings as well. Acting quickly on a concern can save you significant money and stress. Here are the warning signs to watch for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Water marks on ceilings or walls</strong> — Often the first visible sign of a leak. The source may not be directly above the stain.</li>
        <li><strong>Drips or damp patches in the loft</strong> — Check your loft space after heavy rain for any signs of water ingress. Or could be a sign of problematic condensation.</li>
        <li><strong>Slipped, cracked, or missing tiles</strong> — Visible from ground level, these create entry points for water.</li>
        <li><strong>Pieces of cement in gutters</strong> — A sign that your ridge or verge pointing is deteriorating.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaks around chimneys</strong> — One of the most common leak sources, often caused by failing flashing.</li>
        <li><strong>Damage after storms</strong> — High winds can lift tiles and damage flashing, even if it's not immediately visible. Stray debris and tree branches are also a major cause of roof damage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Not sure what you're dealing with? That's exactly what our free survey is for. We'll climb up, inspect properly, and explain what we find in plain English.</p>
      
      <h3>What Our Repair Service Includes</h3>
      <p>We handle all aspects of domestic roof repair, from minor fixes to more complex issues. Our work typically includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tile and slate replacement</strong> — Matching existing materials where possible for a seamless finish.</li>
        <li><strong>Leak detection and repair</strong> — Finding the actual source, not just treating symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Flashing repairs</strong> — Resealing or replacing lead work around chimneys and joints.</li>
        <li><strong>Ridge and hip repairs</strong> — Resecuring loose ridge tiles and repointing as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Gutter and fascia work</strong> — Ensuring water drains away properly from your roof.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency repairs</strong> — Temporary protection when immediate action is needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We always explain what we recommend and why. We don't push unnecessary work.</p>
      
      <h3>Our Repair Process</h3>
      <p>Here's what to expect when you book a repair with us:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Initial contact</strong> — Tell us what you've noticed. Photos help us prepare.</li>
        <li><strong>Site survey</strong> — We inspect the roof properly, not just from the ground.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear explanation</strong> — We show you what we found and explain your options.</li>
        <li><strong>Fixed quote</strong> — No hidden costs. The price we quote is the price you pay.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional repair</strong> — Work completed to high standards, with site left clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Aftercare</strong> — We're here if you have questions after we've finished.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Why Acting Early Matters</h3>
      <p>Small roof problems rarely fix themselves. Wind and rain make them worse over time. Early repairs can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prevent water damage to ceilings, walls, and belongings</li>
        <li>Avoid the need for more extensive (and expensive) work later</li>
        <li>Protect your home's structural integrity</li>
        <li>Give you peace of mind during bad weather</li>
        <li>Maintain your property's value</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you've noticed something that doesn't look right, it's worth getting it checked. Our surveys are free and come with no obligation.</p>

      <h3>When Does a Pitched Roof Need Replacing?</h3>
      <p>A full roof replacement is a significant investment, and it's not always necessary. However, there are situations where replacement is the smarter long-term choice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Multiple leak points</strong> — When water is getting in at several locations, patch repairs become false economy.</li>
        <li><strong>Repairs don't hold</strong> — If fixes keep failing or problems return quickly, the underlying structure may be the issue.</li>
        <li><strong>Widespread tile damage</strong> — Tiles breaking, slipping, or missing frequently indicates the covering has reached end of life.</li>
        <li><strong>Sagging or uneven roofline</strong> — Can indicate structural issues that need addressing with a full replacement.</li>
        <li><strong>Persistent damp in the loft</strong> — Despite repairs, if moisture keeps getting in, the roof membrane may have failed.</li>
        <li><strong>Age of the roof</strong> — Pitched roofs typically last 50-70 years. If yours is approaching this age, replacement may be due.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We'll never recommend replacement if a repair will genuinely solve the problem. Our survey will give you the facts to make an informed decision.</p>
      
      <h3>What a New Pitched Roof Provides</h3>
      <p>Investing in a quality roof replacement delivers benefits that last for decades:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Complete weather protection</strong> — Modern membranes and materials provide superior waterproofing.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved insulation</strong> — Opportunity to upgrade insulation, reducing energy bills.</li>
        <li><strong>No more repairs</strong> — End the cycle of ongoing repair costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced appearance</strong> — A new roof transforms the look of your home.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased property value</strong> — A recent roof replacement is a strong selling point.</li>
        <li><strong>Peace of mind</strong> — Confidence that your home is protected whatever the weather.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Our Replacement Process</h3>
      <p>A roof replacement is a major project. Here's how we approach it:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive survey</strong> — We assess the entire roof structure, not just the covering.</li>
        <li><strong>Options discussion</strong> — We explain material choices and their implications.</li>
        <li><strong>Detailed quote</strong> — Itemised breakdown so you know exactly what you're paying for.</li>
        <li><strong>Scaffolding erection</strong> — Safe access for our team and protection for your property.</li>
        <li><strong>Careful strip-down</strong> — Removing old materials with care for what's below.</li>
        <li><strong>Structural repairs</strong> — Addressing any timber or structural issues found.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality installation</strong> — New membrane, battens, and covering installed to manufacturer specifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Final inspection</strong> — We check every detail before we consider the job complete.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Materials We Use</h3>
      <p>We use quality materials from trusted manufacturers. Depending on your property and preferences, options include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Traditional clay tiles (matching existing character)</li>
        <li>Concrete tiles (cost-effective and durable)</li>
        <li>Natural slate (premium appearance and longevity)</li>
        <li>Composite slates (lighter weight, consistent quality)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We'll advise on what works best for your property type, local planning considerations, and budget.</p>
      
      <h3>Timeline and What to Expect</h3>
      <p>A typical pitched roof replacement typically takes 1-3 weeks, however all work is weather dependent. We'll give you a realistic timeline after the survey. During the work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We maintain access to your home throughout</li>
        <li>The site is secured each evening</li>
        <li>We clean up daily and thoroughly at project end</li>
        <li>We keep you updated on progress</li>

      <h3>Signs Your Flat Roof Needs Replacing</h3>
      <p>Flat roofs have a shorter lifespan than pitched roofs and need more attention. Here are the signs that replacement may be the best option:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ponding water</strong> — Water sitting on the surface after rain indicates poor drainage or surface failure.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple leak points</strong> — When water finds its way in at several locations, patching becomes ineffective.</li>
        <li><strong>Blistering or bubbling</strong> — Trapped moisture expanding in heat, causing delamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Cracks and splits</strong> — The surface has become brittle and is failing.</li>
        <li><strong>Lifting at edges and joints</strong> — Key failure points that let water track underneath.</li>
        <li><strong>Visible decay or soft spots</strong> — The substrate below may be damaged and need replacing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some flat roof problems can be repaired, but if issues keep returning, replacement is often more cost-effective long-term.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Replace Rather Than Repair?</h3>
      <p>If your flat roof is old or showing multiple problems, replacement offers significant advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>End the repair cycle</strong> — No more call-outs every time it rains heavily.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-term protection</strong> — Modern systems come with 20-25 year guarantees.</li>
        <li><strong>Better thermal performance</strong> — Add insulation to meet current standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved drainage</strong> — Proper falls can be incorporated to prevent ponding.</li>
        <li><strong>Superior materials</strong> — Today's systems significantly outperform older felt coverings.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Flat Roof Systems We Install</h3>
      <p>We work with proven flat roof systems, each with their own benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>EPDM Rubber</strong> — Single-piece membrane, extremely durable, 25+ year lifespan. Ideal for most domestic flat roofs.</li>
        <li><strong>Fibreglass (GRP)</strong> — Seamless, rigid finish. Great for roofs that are walked on or used as balconies.</li>
        <li><strong>Single Ply</strong> — Modern membrane system offering excellent durability and weather resistance with proven long-term performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Liquid Plastics</strong> — Seamless liquid-applied waterproofing that adapts to any roof shape, ideal for complex details and repairs.</li>
        <li><strong>High-performance felt</strong> — Torch-applied systems, cost-effective for suitable applications.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We'll recommend the right system based on your roof's size, usage, and budget.</p>
      
      <h3>Our Replacement Process</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Thorough inspection</strong> — We check the substrate, drainage, and surrounding details.</li>
        <li><strong>System recommendation</strong> — We explain which system suits your roof and why.</li>
        <li><strong>Substrate assessment</strong> — If the boards below are damaged, we replace them.</li>
        <li><strong>Insulation upgrade</strong> — We can add or improve insulation in conjunction with updated building regulations.</li>
        <li><strong>New covering installation</strong> — Careful, manufacturer-approved application.</li>
        <li><strong>Perimeter and detailing</strong> — Proper finishing at all edges, upstands, and penetrations.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality check</strong> — Final inspection and water test where appropriate.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Guarantees and Aftercare</h3>
      <p>Your new flat roof comes with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manufacturer's material guarantee (typically 20-25 years)</li>
        <li>Our workmanship guarantee</li>
        <li>Written documentation of the work completed</li>
        <li>Aftercare advice for maintaining your new roof</li>

    content: `
      <h3>What is Lead Flashing?</h3>
      <p>Lead flashing is the unsung hero of a watertight roof. It's the strips of lead that seal the gaps where different parts of your roof meet — around chimneys, at abutments where a roof meets a wall, and at other vulnerable joints.</p>
      <p>When properly installed, lead flashing directs water away from these critical points. When it fails, water finds its way into your home, often causing damage that's disproportionate to the small area of flashing involved.</p>
      
      <h3>Signs Your Leadwork Needs Attention</h3>
      <p>Lead is durable, but it doesn't last forever. Here's what to look for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Damp patches near chimney breasts</strong> — The classic sign of failing chimney flashing.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaks that appear after heavy rain</strong> — Often pointing to flashing failure at a joint.</li>
        <li><strong>Staining on walls</strong> — Water tracking down from a flashing failure above.</li>
        <li><strong>Visible lifting or gaps</strong> — Lead that has pulled away from the wall or roof.</li>
        <li><strong>Cracked cement</strong> — The mortar holding lead into the wall joint has failed.</li>
        <li><strong>White staining on lead</strong> — Oxidation that may indicate the lead is aging.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Why Lead Flashing Matters</h3>
      <p>The joints where different parts of your roof meet are the most vulnerable points for water ingress. Unlike tile or slate damage, which is often visible, flashing failures can go unnoticed until you see the damage inside. Effects can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Damp penetration into walls and ceilings</li>
        <li>Mould growth and associated health issues</li>
        <li>Damage to internal decoration</li>
        <li>Rotting of timber structures over time</li>
        <li>Damage to electrical installations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Good leadwork is about precision and attention to detail — that's where proper craftsmanship makes the difference.</p>
      
      <h3>Our Leadwork Services</h3>
      <p>We provide comprehensive leadwork services including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chimney flashing</strong> — Full replacement or repair of back gutters, stepped flashing, and aprons.</li>
        <li><strong>Abutment flashing</strong> — Where your roof meets walls, extensions, or dormers.</li>
        <li><strong>Valley linings</strong> — The lead channel where two roof sections meet.</li>
        <li><strong>Skylight flashings</strong> — Proper sealing around roof windows and lights.</li>
        <li><strong>Lead repairs</strong> — Patching and resealing where full replacement isn't necessary.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Quality Materials and Techniques</h3>
      <p>We use code 4 and code 5 lead sheet as appropriate for the application, cut and dressed to fit your specific roof. All lead is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Properly fixed to allow for thermal movement</li>
        <li>Dressed carefully into joints and around obstacles</li>
        <li>Treated with patination oil to prevent staining</li>
        <li>Secured to prevent wind lift</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Lead is a traditional material, but proper installation requires skill and experience. Our work is completed to industry standards and built to last.</p>

    content: `
      <h3>What is Roof Pointing?</h3>
      <p>Roof pointing refers to the cement mortar used to secure and seal certain parts of your roof — most commonly along the ridge (the top of the roof), at the hips (angled ridges), and at the verges (roof edges at gable ends).</p>
      <p>This cement work has two jobs: holding tiles in place and keeping water out. When it fails, you get both security and waterproofing problems.</p>
      
      <h3>Signs Your Cement Work Needs Repair</h3>
      <p>Cement work deteriorates over time due to weather, movement, and age. Warning signs include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cracked or crumbling cement</strong> — Visible from ground level along the ridge line.</li>
        <li><strong>Loose ridge tiles</strong> — Movement visible or tiles sitting at an angle.</li>
        <li><strong>Cement debris in gutters</strong> — A clear sign that pointing is breaking up.</li>
        <li><strong>Gaps visible at verges</strong> — The cement seal at roof edges has failed.</li>
        <li><strong>Damp after heavy rain</strong> — Water getting in through failed pointing.</li>
        <li><strong>Moss lifting cement</strong> — Plant growth forcing pointing away from tiles.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Why This Work Matters</h3>
      <p>Failed roof pointing creates two types of risk:</p>
      <p><strong>Water damage:</strong> Once cement fails, water can track underneath tiles and into your roof space. This leads to damp, rot, and potential structural issues.</p>
      <p><strong>Safety hazards:</strong> Loose ridge tiles in high winds can become dangerous projectiles. We've seen tiles travel significant distances, damaging cars, conservatories, and putting people at risk.</p>
      <p>Addressing cement work early prevents these problems and is significantly cheaper than dealing with the consequences.</p>
      
      <h3>Our Cement Work Services</h3>
      <p>We provide comprehensive pointing and cement work including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ridge repointing</strong> — Removing old cement and resecuring ridge tiles with fresh mortar.</li>
        <li><strong>Hip repairs</strong> — Addressing the angled ridges at roof corners.</li>
        <li><strong>Verge pointing</strong> — Resealing the cement at gable edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry ridge systems</strong> — Mechanical fixing alternative to cement (longer-lasting, but not suitable for all properties).</li>
        <li><strong>Bedding repairs</strong> — Where tiles are bedded in mortar at specific points.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Repair vs. Replacement</h3>
      <p>Not all cement work needs complete replacement. We'll assess whether:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Patch repairs</strong> are sufficient for isolated areas</li>
        <li><strong>Repointing</strong> the entire ridge is needed</li>
        <li><strong>A dry ridge system</strong> would be a better long-term solution</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We'll explain the pros and cons of each option so you can make an informed choice.</p>
      
      <h3>Quality and Longevity</h3>
      <p>Proper cement work should last 15-20+ years. We achieve this by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Removing all old, failed mortar completely</li>
        <li>Using quality, flexible cement mixes</li>
        <li>Applying in appropriate weather conditions</li>
        <li>Finishing to a professional standard</li>
        <li>Allowing proper curing time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Quick fixes with inappropriate materials will fail quickly. We do the job properly so you don't need us back sooner than necessary.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Discovering a brown ring or damp patch on your ceiling after heavy rain is worrying. It almost certainly indicates water is getting in somewhere — but the cause isn't always directly above the stain.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Stains Appear After Rain</h3>
      <p>Water stains typically appear because rainwater has found a way into your home. However, there are several possible causes:</p>
      
      <h4>1. Roof Leak</h4>
      <p>The most common cause. Water can enter through damaged tiles, failed flashing, or worn flat roof coverings. Importantly, <strong>water can travel along rafters and joists before dripping down</strong>, meaning the actual leak may be several metres away from where the stain appears.</p>
      
      <h4>2. Condensation</h4>
      <p>Sometimes what looks like a leak isn't one. Poorly insulated or ventilated loft spaces can cause warm, moist air to condense on cold surfaces. This water then drips down, creating stains that appear to be leaks. This is more common in winter and in rooms with high humidity (above bathrooms, kitchens).</p>
      
      <h4>3. Plumbing Issues</h4>
      <p>If you have water tanks, pipes, or an overflow in your loft, check for leaks or overflow issues. A sticking ballcock or weeping pipe joint can produce symptoms identical to a roof leak.</p>
      
      <h4>4. Flashing Failure</h4>
      <p>Where your roof meets a wall, chimney, or other structure, lead flashing seals the joint. If this fails, water tracks down the wall cavity before appearing on an interior ceiling — often some distance from the actual failure point.</p>
      
      <h3>What to Do Next</h3>
      <p>Don't ignore a ceiling stain. Even a small leak can lead to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Timber rot and structural damage</li>
        <li>Mould growth with associated health risks</li>
        <li>Damage to electrical installations</li>
        <li>Eventual ceiling failure in severe cases</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Action steps:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>If safe to do so, check your loft during or after rain for obvious water entry</li>
        <li>Look for wet patches, water tracking marks, or drips</li>
        <li>Don't climb on the roof — it's dangerous and rarely helpful</li>
        <li>Contact a professional for a proper inspection</li>
      </ol>
      <p>A trained roofer can trace the water path back to its source and recommend the appropriate repair.</p>

    content: `
      <p>High winds regularly displace tiles and slates. A single slipped tile might look minor, but it exposes the layer beneath — usually a breathable membrane or old felt — to conditions it wasn't designed to handle long-term.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Tiles Slip</h3>
      <p>Tiles are hung on battens (horizontal timber strips) using a nib (a small projection) that hooks over the batten edge. They slip when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nibs break</strong> — Often due to age, frost damage, or manufacturing defects</li>
        <li><strong>Battens rot</strong> — The timber can decay, losing its grip on the tile</li>
        <li><strong>Nails fail</strong> — Where tiles are nailed, corrosion eventually weakens the fixing</li>
        <li><strong>Wind damage</strong> — Strong gusts can lift tiles, breaking their seating</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>The Risks of Leaving Slipped Tiles</h3>
      <p>A slipped tile creates an opening in your roof's defences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Water entry</strong> — Rain can now reach the felt or membrane, which will degrade if constantly wet</li>
        <li><strong>UV damage</strong> — Sunlight accelerates felt deterioration</li>
        <li><strong>Wind damage</strong> — Gaps allow wind under surrounding tiles, making more likely to slip</li>
        <li><strong>Further slippage</strong> — Tiles depend on their neighbours for stability; gaps create a cascade effect</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>How Urgent Is the Repair?</h3>
      <p>This depends on several factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Single tile, minor slip</strong> — Important to fix, but not an emergency if the felt beneath is intact</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple tiles or missing tiles</strong> — More urgent, as protection is significantly compromised</li>
        <li><strong>Visible felt/membrane damage</strong> — Water is getting through; needs prompt attention</li>
        <li><strong>Bad weather forecast</strong> — Anything compromised should be addressed before storms</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>What Can You Do?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't climb on the roof</strong> — It's dangerous and can cause further damage</li>
        <li><strong>Take photos from ground level</strong> — Useful for explaining the issue</li>
        <li><strong>Check inside</strong> — Look in the loft for signs of water entry</li>
        <li><strong>Arrange professional repair</strong> — A straightforward job for an experienced roofer</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most tile repairs are relatively quick and cost-effective — waiting until there's water damage inside is far more expensive.</p>

    metaDescription: 'Chimney leaks are the most common source of roof problems. Learn about flashing failure, mortar deterioration, and warning signs to watch for.',
    content: `
      <p>Chimneys are the most common source of roof leaks. They penetrate your roof's waterproof barrier and create complex junctions that are vulnerable to failure. Understanding chimney leak causes helps you spot problems early.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Chimneys Leak</h3>
      <p>Several components can fail:</p>
      
      <h4>Lead Flashing Failure</h4>
      <p>Lead flashing seals the junction between chimney and roof. It can fail when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lead cracks due to thermal movement over many heating/cooling cycles</li>
        <li>Lead pulls away from the mortar joint in the brickwork</li>
        <li>The stepped flashing lifts in wind</li>
        <li>The back gutter (behind the chimney) cracks or develops holes</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Mortar Deterioration</h4>
      <p>The mortar joints in the chimney stack itself can become porous over decades, allowing water to soak into the brickwork. The chimney pot flaunching (cement around the pot base) can also crack and fail.</p>
      
      <h4>Chimney Stack Movement</h4>
      <p>Older chimneys can shift slightly over time, breaking the seal between flashing and brickwork.</p>
      
      <h3>Warning Signs of Chimney Leaks</h3>
      <p>Look for these indicators:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Damp patches on the chimney breast</strong> — Often appearing or worsening after rain</li>
        <li><strong>Staining around the fireplace</strong> — Yellow or brown marks</li>
        <li><strong>Peeling wallpaper or bubbling paint</strong> — Near the chimney</li>
        <li><strong>Visible flashing damage</strong> — Gaps, lifting, or missing sections</li>
        <li><strong>Crumbling mortar</strong> — On the chimney stack above the roofline</li>
        <li><strong>White staining on brickwork</strong> — Efflorescence from water passing through</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Repair Options</h3>
      <p>Chimney leak repairs range from straightforward to complex:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reflashing</strong> — Removing old lead and installing new with proper joints</li>
        <li><strong>Repointing</strong> — Renewing mortar joints in the stack</li>
        <li><strong>Reflaunching</strong> — New cement around chimney pots</li>
        <li><strong>Waterproofing</strong> — Specialist coatings for porous brickwork</li>
        <li><strong>Chimney rebuild</strong> — In severe cases, above-roof portions may need reconstruction</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Don't Ignore Chimney Issues</h3>
      <p>Chimney leaks tend to worsen over time. Water tracking down inside walls causes progressive damage that becomes more expensive to address. If you suspect a chimney leak, arranging a professional inspection is worthwhile.</p>

    content: `
      <p>If your felt flat roof looks like the surface of the moon — covered in bubbles, blisters, or bare patches — it's telling you something is wrong. Understanding what causes these problems helps you decide what to do next.</p>
      
      <h3>What Causes Flat Roof Bubbling?</h3>
      <p>Blisters and bubbles form when moisture gets trapped between layers of roofing felt or between the felt and substrate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Moisture trapped during installation</strong> — If felt was laid on damp timber or in wet conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Condensation</strong> — Warm air from inside the building reaches the underside of the cold roof covering</li>
        <li><strong>Water ingress</strong> — Small leaks allow water under the surface</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When the sun heats the roof, this trapped moisture turns to vapour and expands, pushing the layers apart and forming bubbles. Over time, this causes delamination — the layers separate and the roof fails.</p>
      
      <h3>Other Flat Roof Warning Signs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bare or exposed areas</strong> — The mineral surface has worn away</li>
        <li><strong>Cracks and splits</strong> — The material has become brittle</li>
        <li><strong>Ponding water</strong> — Water sits on the surface after rain</li>
        <li><strong>Lifting at edges and seams</strong> — The joins between felt sections are failing</li>
        <li><strong>Moss and plant growth</strong> — Organic matter holds moisture against the surface</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Repair or Replace?</h3>
      <p>This depends on the extent of the problems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Isolated damage</strong> — A few small blisters or a single crack can often be repaired</li>
        <li><strong>Widespread problems</strong> — Multiple issues across the roof suggest the covering has reached end of life</li>
        <li><strong>Deck damage</strong> — If the timber below has rotted, more extensive work is needed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Be wary of 'patch repair' approaches to widespread flat roof problems. If the covering is failing across the board, patches just move the leak somewhere else.</p>
      
      <h3>Modern Flat Roof Solutions</h3>
      <p>If replacement is needed, modern options include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>EPDM rubber</strong> — Single-piece membrane with 25+ year life expectancy</li>
        <li><strong>Fibreglass (GRP)</strong> — Seamless, robust, ideal for trafficked areas</li>
        <li><strong>High-performance felt</strong> — Torch-applied systems, improved durability over old felt</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Replacement also offers the opportunity to add insulation, improving energy efficiency.</p>

    metaDescription: 'What to expect from our free roof survey. We inspect properly, explain what we find in plain English, and give you an accurate quote with no obligation.',
    content: `
      <p>We never quote over the phone or from photos alone. Every roof is different, and accurate advice requires seeing yours in person. Here's what our survey involves and why it matters.</p>
      
      <h3>Why We Survey Before Quoting</h3>
      <p>Phone quotes and estimates are guesswork. They're either too high (because the roofer is protecting themselves from unknowns) or too low (leaving you with unexpected costs later). Our survey-first approach means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We see the actual problem, not just symptoms you've described</li>
        <li>We can identify related issues you may not have noticed</li>
        <li>Our quote is based on facts, not assumptions</li>
        <li>The price we quote is the price you pay (barring genuine unforeseen issues)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>What Happens During the Survey</h3>
      <p>A typical survey takes 20-45 minutes depending on what's involved:</p>
      
      <h4>1. Initial Discussion</h4>
      <p>We start by listening. You explain what you've noticed — when problems occur, where you see symptoms, any relevant history. This guides our inspection.</p>
      
      <h4>2. External Inspection</h4>
      <p>We assess the roof properly, which typically means getting up for a close look. We examine:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tile or covering condition</li>
        <li>Ridge, hip, and edge details</li>
        <li>Flashings around chimneys and junctions</li>
        <li>Valleys and guttering</li>
        <li>Flat roof areas</li>
        <li>General condition and signs of wear</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>3. Internal Check</h4>
      <p>If relevant, we'll ask to look in your loft space. Signs of water ingress are often visible here before they show on ceilings. We check for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Water staining on timbers</li>
        <li>Daylight visible through the roof</li>
        <li>Damp or damaged insulation</li>
        <li>Condensation issues</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>4. Photo Documentation</h4>
      <p>We photograph any issues we find. These photos become part of your quote — you'll see exactly what we're recommending and why.</p>
      
      <h4>5. Discussion and Explanation</h4>
      <p>After the inspection, we explain what we found in plain English. No jargon, no pressure. We cover:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What the problem is and what's causing it</li>
        <li>What needs addressing now vs. what can wait</li>
        <li>Your options and our recommendation</li>
        <li>What the work involves</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>After the Survey</h3>
      <p>You'll receive a written quote, typically within 24-48 hours. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear description of the work proposed</li>
        <li>Photos showing what we found</li>
        <li>Fixed price for the agreed scope</li>
        <li>Estimated timeframe</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There's no pressure to proceed. The choice is entirely yours.</p>

    metaDescription: 'What is lead flashing and why does it matter? Learn about this critical roofing component, signs of failure, and when repair or replacement is needed.',
    content: `
      <p>Lead flashing is one of those building components most people never think about until it fails. Yet it's critical to keeping water out of your home. Here's what you need to know.</p>
      
      <h3>What is Lead Flashing?</h3>
      <p>Lead flashing is strips or sheets of lead used to seal junctions on your roof. The most common locations are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Around chimneys</strong> — Stepped flashing up the sides, a back gutter behind, and an apron at the front</li>
        <li><strong>Where roof meets wall</strong> — At abutments, typically stepped or continuous flashing</li>
        <li><strong>Around roof windows</strong> — Skylights and Velux windows have lead or similar seals</li>
        <li><strong>In valleys</strong> — Where two roof slopes meet, a lead-lined channel carries water away</li>
        <li><strong>At parapet walls</strong> — Around flat roof edges with upstands</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Why Lead is Used</h3>
      <p>Lead has been the material of choice for centuries because it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Can be shaped and dressed to fit complex junctions</li>
        <li>Is highly durable (properly installed lead lasts 50-100+ years)</li>
        <li>Is malleable and can be worked without heat</li>
        <li>Is self-healing for minor scratches</li>
        <li>Has a proven track record across all UK building types</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Signs Your Flashing May Be Failing</h3>
      <p>Look for these warning signs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Damp patches inside</strong> — Especially on chimney breasts or near roof-wall junctions</li>
        <li><strong>Visible gaps</strong> — Lead that has pulled away from the wall</li>
        <li><strong>Cracked or split lead</strong> — Usually visible as lines across the metal</li>
        <li><strong>Failed mortar</strong> — The cement holding lead into wall joints has crumbled</li>
        <li><strong>White staining on tiles</strong> — Lead oxide running down from ageing lead above</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Repair vs. Replacement</h3>
      <p>Minor flashing issues can sometimes be repaired:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Repointing where lead is set into the wall</li>
        <li>Patching small cracks or holes</li>
        <li>Resecuring lifted sections</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, if lead is extensively cracked, has thinned from wear, or has failed at multiple points, replacement is usually more cost-effective long-term.</p>
      
      <h3>Patination Oil</h3>
      <p>If you see white streaks running down your roof tiles from lead above, this is lead carbonate (oxidation). While not immediately harmful, it indicates the lead wasn't treated with patination oil after installation. This oil can be applied to stop further staining and help the lead weather to its characteristic grey colour.</p>
      
      <h3>Getting Flashing Checked</h3>
      <p>Flashing problems often show up as interior damp before you see obvious external issues. If you have unexplained damp patches, particularly near chimneys or where your roof meets a wall, it's worth having the flashing inspected by a professional.</p>
